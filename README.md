# TCSPCAnalysis
This repository contains code demos used to prototype the analysis of TCSPC
data, but may be of use for other non-linear fitting and confidence interval
estimation applications.  Written in MATLAB due to the presence of an existing
codebase that was extended to actually perform data analysis on experimeental
data.

An example of how to use fourParamterFit(...) is given in fitting.m
An example of how to use bootstrap(...) is given in bootstrapping.m
